                    <p>Hi! My name is Thibault, This site is a result of what i came up with while learning Jekyll. I built this from a template i found in Jekyll themes. The purpose of this is to have some sort of online presence.
I will be updating the blog side of it as much as i can and also the projects i worked on, different ideas i tried or want to work on. I believe in the power of open source so if you wanna collaborate on any of the projects , Don't hesitate to reach out to me in any way suitable for you ;)</p>
