Hey kids, this is a story of how i met your mother, it started in 2014 when i was a fresh graduate, didn't have a job and started looking for internships and free training thinking that i lacked the skills to get me a job.

i ended up taking an introduction to programming which was offered by Carnegie Mellon University (Rwanda Campus) in partnership with kLab an innovation center in Kigali. When this training was about to end, one of the mentors asked the two of us if we were interested in small project that would involve learning a new MVC framework. This was exciting news because PLAY (the framework we learned in the training) was too difficult for me. if it's your first time learning MVC frameworks, please don't start with PLAY....
