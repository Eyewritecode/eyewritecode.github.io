Hey kids, this is a story of how i met Ruby, it started in 2014 when i was a fresh graduate, didn't have a job (that i wanted) and started looking for internships and free training thinking that i lacked the skills to get me a job.

I ended up taking a one month introduction to programming summer class (mind you i was a computer science graduate) which was offered by Carnegie Mellon University (Rwanda Campus) in partnership with kLab an innovation center in Kigali. The program covered Javascript, Java and an intro to MVC framework. To be honest, i learned more in one month than my 4 years at Uni. Thanks Cathy :)

When this course was about to end, one of the mentors asked the two of us (the chosen ones \o/) if we were interested in a small project that would involve learning a new MVC framework. This was exciting news because PLAY, the framework we learned in the class! was too difficult for me. 

if it's your first time learning MVC frameworks, please don't start with PLAY or do, so that you can enjoy other frameworks ;)

Anyways, the framework was *drum rolls* Ruby on Rails!  
I went straight on google just to check how different it was from PLAY. first impression; there was enough resources about it. PLAY on the other hand, only had a few blog posts about and its official documentation!

There's something about official documentations that makes it so hard to understand but that will be for another day!

From Google's first result page, i was sold. It was gonna be me and ruby against the world. The project was about helping a guy who owned several milk collection centers manage his spendings... you can call it a supply chain management system but that would take the fun out of it.

We were a team of three developers, two noobs and one senior. i was in charge of the UX/UI, the second noob took care of the back-end and the senior fixed bugs :D
Eventhough this project wasn't succesfull, i learned about trello, prototyping with myBalsamiq and got introduced to Git/Github.


As i'm new to this blogging thing, i will just end it like this.
