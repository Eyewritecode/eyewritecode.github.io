If you're like me, you probably check what other people think about a certain product before making your decision.
The potential of this can drive you to make a purchase or forget about the product.
Many brands have noticed the power of peer pressure and invested quite a lot into using other people a.k.a "influencers" to push normal people like me and you to buy certain products. As they say:

right!? Well, i was blind. Until recently, when i was going through Upwork gigs and came across this posting.

This is one of many 'scams' around the internet that intends to make you throw your money on services/products/apps unintentionally.

Some upwork gigs even provide the reviews you should copy and paste on the products.

For a business owner, the need of making more money is undeniable. For someone like me who needs to make easy money, this can be very tempting and it all comes down to your ethics and what you think is fair.

So next time before purchasing that product, course or app think twice and check for some uniformity in the reviews.

Do you think this is a good or bad practice? Let's argue below :)
