Coding is fun they said!
This is what has been portrayed by blogs, documentaries, movies, speeches...for the past 2 or 3 years.

What they didn't mention was that it's never fun when you're doing it alone. The self taught tag seem to push to jump in tutorials, books and you feel that you'll be the next DHH. 

I downloaded everything that i could download, filled my external HDD with tutorials and started my self taught journey. 

Android was the hit at that time(2012)
