Coding is fun they said!
In *inserts year* there will be *inserts percentage* unfilled job positions in IT field they said!

This is what has been portrayed by blogs, documentaries, movies, speeches...for the past 2 or 3 years.

What they didn't mention was that it's never fun when you're doing it alone. The self taught tag, starting a startup buzz, dropping out... seem to push everyone to jump into tutorials, books and you feel that you'll be the next DHH

I fell for it. I downloaded everything that i could get my cursor on, filled my external HDD with tutorials and started my "self taught" journey. 

Android was the ish at that time(2012) at least at my university. I watched everything that was on Bucky's youtube channel about android! (I wonder if he's still making videos)
I did all that because my undergrad thesis was about android. i "supposedly" made an android application for guardians to be able to track the location of their kids while not at home. I even made an [interview](https://wazaonline.com/fr/rencontres-et-profils/thibault-mutabazi-createur-dappli) about it
