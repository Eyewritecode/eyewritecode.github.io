>Coding is fun they said!


>In "insert year" there will be "insert percentage" unfilled job positions in IT field they said!

This is what has been portrayed by blogs, documentaries, movies, speeches...for the past 2 or 3 years.(depending on when you read this)

What they didn't mention was that it's never fun when you're doing it alone. The self taught tag, starting a startup buzz, dropping out... seem to push everyone to jump into tutorials, books and you feel that you'll be the next DHH.

I fell for it. I downloaded everything that i could get my cursor on, filled my external HDD with tutorials and started my "self taught" journey. 

Android was the ish at that time(2012) at least at my university. I watched everything that was on Bucky's youtube channel about android! (I wonder if he's still making videos).<br>
All that because my undergrad thesis was about android. i "supposedly" made an android application for guardians to be able to track the location of their kids while not at home. By the way, I even made an [interview](https://wazaonline.com/fr/rencontres-et-profils/thibault-mutabazi-createur-dappli) about it ;)

I gotta say my efforts to learn android didn't turn to ashes, I got few gigs for android apps and it helped gain new skills. some of them are:

	1. Mobile banking
	2. Event Management
	3. Telco Voice recorder tool
	4. Arduino GSM controller
	5. SMS gateway

Anyways, back to why i started the community. While working on the mentioned arduino projects, i could reach out to people familiar with the technology and they would help me whenever i was stuck. However, android developers were not that in demand. It was either wordpress websites or some web apps for management systems.<br>
My ruby on rails skills were not enough to handle a project alone, i decided to look for people around me who were already using it.<br>
Linkedin came first on my mind. "Ruby on rails rwanda" were the keywords i used, to my surprise, only a few people had it in their profiles and they were all working for a same company.<br>
I messaged everyone who seemed "approachable" but i got nothing in return :/ <br>
At this time i was now looking for an internship or any way i could be involved in more projects that uses Ruby on Rails in the dev. That was clearly unsuccessful. I then joined the [nairobi ruby meetup](http://nairuby.org/) and followed anyone on twitter who had anything to do with ruby. This mentioned, i gotta thank [Emad](https://twitter.com/blaz_boy) for his [Ruby daily posts](https://www.facebook.com/rubydailyscripts/?fref=ts) helped me a lot :)

So as things didn't go as i wished, i decided to start a [community](https://twitter.com/rwandaonrails) where now they would be the ones to come to me.
